ðŸ›’ Pick2Go â€“ Grocery App UI (User Side)
Welcome to the official repository for the Pick2Go grocery shopping application â€“ User Side UI/UX Design.
This project focuses on delivering a user-friendly, visually appealing, and smart interface to enhance the local grocery shopping experience.
Pick2Go is a grocery app concept that allows users to:
Browse products listed by multiple local shopkeepers
Compare prices for the same product across different sellers
Add items to their cart
Download a PDF of cart items
Collect their order offline from the chosen shop
The aim is to empower local vendors, provide users with choice & transparency, and blend digital convenience with offline accessibility.
